# PowerProfiler

## Project Overview

This is just a fun personal project to practice the uses of APIs and also get familiar with GUI projects. 

I hope to gain insight on best practices when it comes to using APIs; like security with tokens, different uses for calls (GET, POST, DEL, etc), and structuring my code when using an API. I also plan on using Azure DevOps platform to build and publish and artifact of the character builds. I believe going this extra step will help me with configuring and understanding end to end processes of software development.

The use of the GUI will be new to me. I have not had any projects that use GUIs, so I believe learning and understanding how the front-end interacts with the back-end will also help me in getting a deeper knowledge of how more robust applications operate.

As stated earlier, I plan to use Azure DevOps platform to build and test the application to have some automation involved. I will also utlize Azure KeyVault to store sensitive data and access that data through ADO to be able to connect to the API.

## Preparation

# Questions:

* How can I get information about a specific character?

* How to get the id mathcing the indentifying character?

* What information is presented in the API call and how should i parse it?

* How to display the character image and stats in the GUI?
